# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Movie-Reviews
The aim of Sentiment analysis is to accurately extract people’s opinions from a large number 
of unstructured review texts and classify them into sentiment classes, i.e., positive or negative.

Sentiment analysis can be used to determine the attitude of the reviewer with respect to various 
topics or the overall polarity of the review.

To perform a binary classification i.e. we will classify the sentiment as positive or negative 
according to the `Reviews’ column data of the IMDB dataset. 

We will use TFIDF for text vectorization and Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naïve Bayes, and 
Linear Support Vector Machine models for classification.

Compare the training performance of these models.
